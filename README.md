# Glory
Runtime permission requester, request dangerous permissions through Glory easily.

## Prerequisites
First, dependency must be added to build.gradle file.
```groovy
implementation 'nurisezgin.com.glory:glory:1.0.2'
```

## How To Use

* Build Glory instance with builder.
```java
    Glory glory = Glory.builder()
        .context(ctx)
        .permissions(permissions)
        .build();
```

* Send a permission request.
```java
    glory.request(CallbackFactory.newCallback((response -> {
        // sth...
    })));
```

* If you want to show rationale you can enable on builder. Also Glory has own activity for requesting permission but you can change requester
through builder and add customized one.
```java
    final String[] permissions = {Manifest.permission.READ_SMS,
            Manifest.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION};

    Glory.builder()
            .context(ctx)
            .requestCode(101) // optional
            .rationale("Message") // optional
            .permissions(permissions)
            .requester(customRequester) // optional
            .build()
            .request(CallbackFactory.newCallback((response -> {
                // sth...
            })));
```
